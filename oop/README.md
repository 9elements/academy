This chapter will go through some intermediate concepts of object design:

# SOLID

The term solid was coined by Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob). Each letter stands for a strategy to write clean code:

## Single Responsiblity Principle

Every class or function that you write should have only one purpose. If it has multiple purposes think of a way to split it up into multiple pieces. The reasoning behind this is to create code that is easier to test in isolation. The code will also be more modular and sharable across projects.
