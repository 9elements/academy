# Project Reporting

At 9elements we run many projects in parallel. To keep all the crew members informed we sent a newsletter at the end of each month with little status updates about the project.

Your task will be to model an information system to implement the process.

## Customer Journeys

- An employee can add or remove projects.
- Employess can be assigned to a project.
- An employee can add or remove a report to a project.
- In the end of a month all reports should be collected that hasn't been published yet and they have to be sent via email grouped by projcts.
