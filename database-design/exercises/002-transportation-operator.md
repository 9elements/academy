# Transportation Operator

The VRR wants to reimplement the heart of their IT system.

You'll have to manage autobus lines (like CE31 or 356). Each line has several stops. Each stop will have multiple times of arrival seperated by workdays (monday to friday), saturday and sunday.

## Customer Joerneys

As a customer I want to define a location and start date. I should see my next opportunities to take the next bus.
